	Chemical process simulation software helps broaden an engineer's capabilities and increases productivity. It supercharges an engineer's efficiency when facing the toughest chemical process models or addressing day-to-day challenges. They have potential instructional value for practically all core courses, right from first year process calculations to final year design project. It integrates all the topics under one roof making it one of the most powerful tool for a process/chemical engineer. CHEMCAD is one such simulation software featuring a rich Graphical User Interface (GUI) allowing the user to understand the behavior of the chemical systems by using rigorous models of thermodynamic processes and unit operations. In the previous edition of Engineer a workshop on CHEMCAD was organized giving everyone a hands-on experience with all the technical details and theory involved. No pre-requisites are required for this event. Generally the workshop will be followed up by an exciting event based on software taken up in the workshop.<br/><br/>
