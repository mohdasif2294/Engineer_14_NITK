	Marathon is an event that inculcates multiple tasks of varying difficulty covering all fields of computer science from basic programming, scripting, to operating systems and networks. In the previous edition of Engineer, Marathon was planned to be more challenging, which tested the mind of the participants with the latest developing technologies in the field of Computer Science. After all, Computer Science is the fastest  growing and the fastest changing area of Engineering. Spread over all of Engineer, participants are given the opportunity to make up for one bad day, as well as test  how long one can persist solving the trickiest (and most often the simplest) computer science problems thrown at them! People can participate for this event in teams of three.<br /><br />
